# Historical Emacs tarballs

## Provenance

- emacs-v170.tap from Richard Alderson.

  TECO EMACS.

- emacs-16.56.tar.gz from Noah Friedman.

  "In 1993 I recovered a copy of the Emacs 16.56 sources from backup
  tapes at MIT because rms needed it in a court case with Unisys.  I
  put it back up for ftp a couple of years later and it's relatively
  easy to find these days."
